### Project Overview
The data contains information regarding the interaction of users in both groups with the two versions of the landing page.

**Data Dictionary:**
- user_id - Unique user ID of the person visiting the website.
- group - Whether the user belongs to the first group (control) or the second group (treatment).
- landing_page - Whether the landing page is new or old
- time_spent_on_the_page - Time (in minutes) spent by the user on the landing page
- converted - Whether the user gets converted to a subscriber of the news portal or not
- language_preferred - Language chosen by the user to view the landing page.

- Checking the shape of the dataset
- Getting the statistical summary for the variables
- Check for missing values
- Check for duplicates

**Data Overview**
1. Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than the existing landing page?
2. Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?
3. Is the conversion and preferred language are independent or related?
4. Is the time spent on the new page same for the different language users?

### Conclusion and Business Recommendations

**Conclusion**
- It is observed that users spend more time on the new landing page compared to the old one, this indicates that the new design and content are more engaging.
- The conversion rate for the new landing page is significantly greater than that for the old landing page. This suggests that the new design is more effective at converting users into subscribers.
- There is no significant association between a user’s preferred language and their likelihood of converting, suggesting that the new page’s effectiveness is independent of the language.
- There is no significant difference in the average time spent on the new landing page by users of different language preferences. The engagement time is roughly the same regardless of the

**Business Recommendations**
- The new landing page has proven to increase both user engagement (time spent on the page) and conversion rates. E-News Express should roll out the new landing page to all users. This will likely result in an increase in new subscribers, addressing the recent decline.
- The new landing page design has positively affected user engagement and conversions; further investment in enhancing the quality and relevance of the content could lead to even better results. Regular updates and optimizations based on user feedback and behavior analysis should be considered.
- As there is no significant correlation between language preference and conversion rates, E-news Express should continue to offer the landing page in multiple languages but does not need to prioritize one over the other
- Regular monitoring and analysis of user behavior data should be done to identify any emerging trends or potential issues with the new landing page. This will help in making data-driven decisions for future optimizations.
- E-news Express is likely to enhance user engagement and achieve a sustainable increase in new subscribers.
